# Project Rainfall
This is an idea I came up with to track rainfall data. When I was a child we had a paper sheet on the wall that we would use to keep track of how much rain we'd had.
One year I decided to keep track of it with an excel spread sheet as this felt modern. Now as I stare out my window, trying to think of a new project to work on,
I notice that it's raining, and my tradition of keeping track of rainfall has been lost. I decide I want to try out some new ways to do things, and build a full stack
application to fulfil this purpose. This mono repo contains the front end (Vite + React + TS), the backend (GO), and Database (SQLite) to fulfil this purpose.

# Front end
Write stuff about front end and how to run

# Back end
Write stuff about back end and how to run

# Database
